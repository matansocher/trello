feat - create new board in home page
feat - add another query param for the modal to automatically open
feat - add labels picker to card modal in 2 places
feat - add option to add cover to a ticket
feat - add checklist to card info in card modal

bug - when saving description or due date or probably anything - the card is updated but the card preview is not
bug - from home page click on one of the boards links in the header or in the home page itself - the board is not loaded
bug - click outside a dropdown and it stays open
